This is my second post! 

I haven't update my blog for quite a long time. Check out my new C++ open-source project!

	:::cpp
	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;

	int main(int argc, char **argv){
		cout << "hello, world!" << endl;
	}


Here is the Python port.

	:::py
	def say_hello():
		print "hello, world!"

	if __name__ == "__main__":
		say_hello()
